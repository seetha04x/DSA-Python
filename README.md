# DSA-Python

Welcome to my repository for Data Structures and Algorithms! This project tracks my progress through LeetCode problems and serves as a library of optimized solutions and notes.

## 🚀GOALS
- Master fundamental Data Structures (Trees, Graphs, Linked Lists).
- Maintain a daily coding streak to improve problem-solving speed.

## 🧮REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
The solutions are organized by topic to make navigation easy:
- `/Arrays` - Array manipulation and Hashing.
- `/SlidingWindow` - Optimization problems using windowing.
- `/Trees` - Binary trees, BST, and Traversal techniques.
